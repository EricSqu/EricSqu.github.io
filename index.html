        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate Computer Science student at UCF, with a keen interest in developing innovative solutions through coding and technology. My journey began in high school, where I discovered my interest taking an AP computer science class my senor year, leading me to pursue a degree focused on software development and data analysis</p>
        <p>Beyond the classroom, I've honed my skills through internships, including a notable experience at SOFWERX, where I worked with an expert team to gain practical experience. My expertise spans languages like C and Java, and I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of AI and machine learning</p>
        <p>Through my personal website, I share insights on my projects, from website development to robotics, aiming to connect with like-minded professionals and contribute to meaningful technological advancements.</p>
